this prototype was used to test how to make a score counter, that goes up when a object in the game is collided with. in this case, when the fish is eaten by the shark (controlled by the player with WASD). the fish is not deleted, but its state is changed, it has a different sprite, and it no longer triggers the counter to increase when collided with.
